It’s throw-back Sunday! Back in September, before you left for Perth, we (plus dad) visited Emerald Lake Park. It’s a park found in the heart of Emerald, over in the Dandenong Ranges. As the name suggests, there’s a lake, and where there’s a lake, there’s got to be paddle boats!

Here’s what "Cardinia Shire":cardinia-shire has to say about the park:

bq. Emerald Lake Park is truly a ‘park for all seasons’. Visitors can seek relief from the summer heat under the cool established trees or enjoy a splash in the wading pool. In autumn, they can enjoy the old favourite ‘shuffle’ through fallen leaves and the spectacular display of autumnal colours. Then brisk walks through misty mornings in the wintertime are followed by the joy of spring flowers and the arrival of ducklings and moorchicks.

I’d like to come back here again sometime this spring. There are a few more trails around the park that I want to see, and it’s a lovely place for a leisurely stroll. And the Puffing Billy stops here, so I can take some photos of the steam train!

Here are some photos to remind you of the day.
