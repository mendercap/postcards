I visited Silvan Reservoir Park last weekend. It's a 15 minutes' drive northeast of Boronia. According to Wiki, the reservoir itself was built between 1926 and 1931; it supplies water to the eastern suburbs, but also Greenvale!

"Parks Victoria":parks-victoria has this to say about the park:

bq. Set in the foothills of the Dandenong Ranges, Silvan Reservoir Park is an easy drive from Melbourne and ideal for a great day out. Featuring landscaped picnic areas and open lawns surrounded by an impressive eucalypt forest, this park is perfect for a picnic or barbecue.

The eucalyptus forest on the approach to the park is stunning: it's a good long stretch of thick, towering trees that barely let any sunlight through. Too bad there was nowhere to park along the road, so I didn't end up taking any photos of the trees.

Pics ahoy!
