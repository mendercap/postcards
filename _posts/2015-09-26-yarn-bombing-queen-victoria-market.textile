Yesterday I went for a walk around the Queen Victoria Market. Several of the London Plane Trees along Therry Street have been dressed up in colourful crocheted coats.

According to the little cards attached to the coats, the crocheting was done by the "Yarn Corner":yarn-corner. Their website mentions that they're one of the largest yarn bombing groups in the world, with around a thousand members. And they do commissions! Too bad we don't get a tree in our Craigieburn house.

Pics below!
