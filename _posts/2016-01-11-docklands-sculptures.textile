Every (well, most) lunchtime I go out for a walk around Melbourne. Last Thursday, I decided to head in the opposite direction to the usual citybound stroll and found myself in Docklands.

According to "Wiki":docklands-wiki, Docklands occupies what used to be swampland prior to the 1880, when the area came to be used as a dock. It fell out of use as such by the 1990s. Around this time, Docklands became popular as an underground rave sceneâ€”a reputation it maintains to this day with rave events held at Docklands Stadium.

There are a number of art installations in Docklands. I got the chance to photograph a handful of them, but there are many more. I may well return later this week and hunt for the others (if you like the photos I post here!).

Without further ado, the photos!
